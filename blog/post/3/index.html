      <p> </p>
      <p>There is no denying that the power of AI that generates text,
        images, and even videos is transforming the way we work by
        changing how humans interact with technology. AI seems more like
        a real person working with you these days than just another
        tool.</p>
      <p>But does AI have a limit? Despite the large amount of tasks
        ChatGPT and other tools are able to take on, there are still
        areas where they fall short. One such example is when <font
          color="#33ff33"><a moz-do-not-send="true"
            href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-hallucinations">a
            chatbot comes to a conclusion based on data that simply is
            not true</a></font>.</p>
      <p>In some cases chatbots lack understanding context the same way
        humans can. Sometimes it inherits misunderstandings from the
        datasets that not even chatbot creators have a full expertise
        on.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The best visual representation of AI meeting its limit comes
        from a project from <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://oasis.decart.ai/welcome">OASIS</a>. OASIS is an
        AI generated version of the popular indie game Minecraft from <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/markus-persson/">Markus
          Persson (also known as Notch)</a> available to play in a web
        browser.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The AI was trained upon tons of keyboard and mouse inputs
        synced with video footage. This way we can attempt to move our
        virtual character, as one does while playing a video game, and
        the real time AI generated video will respond to our inputs. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The game works, but is not an acceptable product in terms of a
        game you can sell at the store. Minecraft is a game where a
        player is meant to shape their world by breaking and replacing
        blocks.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Most players have experienced the AI generating <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://x.com/CitrusSire/status/1853223681008472324">entire
          houses from one block they place</a>. Other players have
        experienced their houses <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/1852648456084464035">disappearing
          after simply looking away</a> from them in game.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;It appears that while the AI in OASIS exhibits some
        creativity and behavior, it still reproduces outputs that reveal
        a lack of comprehension about the project at hand. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The OASIS project also underscores the issue of data dependency
        in AI. The system was trained on a large dataset of keyboard and
        mouse movements synced with gameplay footage. While this might
        seem like a sound approach, it’s ultimately limited by the
        quality and scope of the data.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The AI can replicate actions based on the patterns it has seen,
        but it doesn’t truly understand the rules of the world it is
        creating. In a complex, open-ended game like Minecraft, this is
        a serious limitation. The AI cannot anticipate or adapt to the
        nuances of player behavior in the way human game developers can.
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>OASIS brought popularity to other AI generated gaming projects
        that flew under the radar. Although an AI generated version of
        the shooting game <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/google-used-ai-to-recreate-doom-and-people-cant-tell-it-from-the-real-thing">Doom</a>,
        and an AI generated version of <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://x.com/EloiAlonso1/status/1844803606064611771">Counter
          Strike Global Offensive</a> seemed to run with less problems,
        the completely different gameplay of Minecraft is currently out
        of reach in what AI is able to artificially understand. <br>
