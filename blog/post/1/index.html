      <h1 align="center">ChatGPT: Will it replace human programmers?</h1>
      <hr style="border: 1px solid yellow; margin: 20px 0;">
      <p>When OpenAI introduced ChatGPT to the public many thought that
        Chatbots would be able to program whatever you asked it to. Many
        chatbots were even able to debug the code it created, in case it
        generated something that did not work as intended. Inevitably,
        many assumed that AI would eventually replace programmers, but
        some research shows that may not be the case…yet.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Studies published in the June issue of <font color="#33ff33"><a
            moz-do-not-send="true"
            href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chatgpt-for-coding"><i>IEEE
              Transactions on Software Engineering</i></a></font>
        determined ChatGPT is not constantly able to output working
        code. The study found when it came to producing functional code,
        the success rate was between 0.66 and 89 percent. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Programmers in today's workforce deal with a wide variety of
        tasks. Some of these tasks are simple, while others are complex.
        The difficulty of the task measured differs depending on what
        programmer you ask. However for ChatGPT, the chatbot will find
        its struggles based on the programming language in question, the
        imported packages being used in each program, and how many tasks
        have to be accomplished for each program.<br>
      </p>
      <p>ChatGPT can fail to program simply because it does not
        understand what it is being asked to accomplish. This can likely
        be attributed to all the different human and programming
        languages the AI had to be trained to recognize the prompts. In
        addition, programming capabilities were not only what OpenAI
        wanted to accomplish with ChatGPT. <br>
      </p>
      <p>ChatGPT is being used for much more than programming. People
        use ChatGPT to review grammar in their emails and ask questions
        for quick answers generated from its huge library of data. I
        personally have used ChatGPT many times throughout the summer to
        rediscover movies that I remembered the plot of, but could not
        remember the title of.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So does this mean using ChatGPT to generate code is a waste of
        time? I do not think so. The June issue of <font
          color="#33ff33"><a moz-do-not-send="true"
            href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chatgpt-for-coding"><i>IEEE
              Transactions on Software Engineering</i></a></font> also
        found that “in some cases the AI generator could produce better
        code than humans…”, but the studies also found their “…analysis
        also reveals some security concerns with AI-generated code.”
        (Hampson) <br>
      </p>
      <p>It is important to note evidence of security concerns from the
        AI-generated code is concerning. My belief stems from the
        evidence that only C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python were
        tested throughout the entire study. With that in mind, there are
        many untested security concerns that may exist in other scripts
        when AI generates both HTML and JavaScript in the same output.<br>
      </p>
      <p>For example, I told ChatGPT I wanted to build a homepage that
        would not show contents on the page until I entered a passcode.
        The chatbot generated a working page, however the code I needed
        to enter to access the page was visible in plain site. The code
        was not hashed, or stored on a secure server so a person with
        basic inspect element skills could bypass the lock. In addition,
        the chatbot did not recommend having the login page separate
        from the page that has the content. This means the content on
        the webpage was still being loaded into the visitor’s browser,
        despite them not being authorized to access the content in
        theory.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The closest I got to a warning about the potential dangerous of
        deploying such a page was from a less popular chatbot. Google
        Gemini functions very similarly to ChatGPT, but there is
        noticeable differences. This is to be expected since both
        products come from entirely different places, and ChatGPT gets <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/chatgpt/chatgpt-vs-gemini-which-ai-has-more-users">way
          more visitors than Google Gemini</a> to train with. Google
        Gemini when it generates code displays a warning. The warning
        says "Use code with caution" and clicking it links to a <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13954172?hl=en#zippy=%2Cuse-code-with-caution">support
          page</a> that suggests vulnerabilities could exist within the
        generated code.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The researchers in the June Issue found that many of the
        vulnerabilities in the AI generated code were easily fixable.
        However, many of these vulnerabilities will go undetected,
        unless a real programmer is there to check the code. That’s why
        in the future, I believe AI will become a powerful tool for
        programmers to code with, rather than AI replacing programmers.
        Many programmers use IDEs to write their code. IntelliJ has
        begun to include an AI assistant in its products that can
        artificially generate explanations to what code does. Since some
        of its software is free, students will likely install it and
        learn to code with the AI assistant.<br>
