      <p> </p>
      <p>When starting out in the world of programming, choosing the
        right language to learn first can be a pivotal decision. Among
        the most popular and accessible options are Python and
        JavaScript. Both languages are suited to different kinds of
        development. But the question remains: should you learn Python
        or JavaScript first?</p>
      <p>To answer this, we need to consider the usage of the languages,
        and the kinds of projects you want to work on. Let's break this
        down.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2>Let's Learn Python First!</h2>
      <p>Generally speaking in 2024, Python is the language that's
        usually recommended for beginners because of its simplicity and
        readability. Python has relatively clean syntax and, therefore,
        is understandable, which makes it also good to learn. A major
        selling point of Python deals with what you can do with it. You
        can use it for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data Science</li>
        <li>Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Automation</li>
        <li>Web Development (backend)</li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The good thing about Python is that, in addition to its
        extensive documentation, the community is typically more
        friendly to those wanting to learn it than the Java community
        and even the JavaScript community. With that in mind, it will be
        easier to search out and find help on forums when you're just
        starting.</p>
      <p>At the repository level, Python is one of the most popular
        languages on GitHub. That means you're going to find more
        open-source projects made with Python compared to JavaScript.
        Once you learn Python, you can have access to a large amount of
        pre-built libraries and tools, which will make learning and
        development speedier. Additionally, Python has extensive
        tutorials and free courses available online for learning the
        subject.</p>
      <p>However, Python isn't used in client-side development. It would
        be applicable only on the backend side of developing web
        applications. Its most recognizable frameworks are typically
        Django and Flask. For instance, Python doesn't play a role in
        composing an interactive, dynamic user interface, which modern
        websites demand. If your primary interest lies in web
        development, especially in frontend development, Python will not
        be the most appropriate starting point.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2>No! Let's Learn JavaScript First!</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is the language of the web. If you are interested in
        creating interactive websites, dynamic user interfaces, or
        front-end web applications, learning JavaScript is a must.
        JavaScript is the backbone of web interactivity. It powers
        everything from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Animations</li>
        <li>Form validation</li>
        <li>Client-side data fetching</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In fact, JavaScript is the only language that runs in all
        modern web browsers. With this in mind, you can write code that
        works directly within the browser. JavaScript is a key language
        that makes the web interactive.</p>
      <p>For a beginner looking to develop web applications, JavaScript
        offers an immediate payoff. With the addition of learning
        Node.js along with JavaScript, you can use JavaScript for
        back-end development as well. This allows developers to use the
        same language across both the client and server sides, making it
        a powerful tool for full-stack development. Additionally,
        frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js have further
        solidified JavaScript as the go-to language for building modern
        web applications.</p>
      <p>Although learning JavaScript might be harder than learning
        Python, it might pay off by opening up more job opportunities.
        JavaScript's syntax is more complex, just like how Java's syntax
        is complex. That is why going from learning JavaScript to Java
        can be easier than going from learning Python to Java.</p>
      <p>Don't forget that because JavaScript is so widely used across
        the web, the demand for JavaScript developers remains extremely
        high, which can translate into better job opportunities.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion: Which Should You Learn First?</h2>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Deciding whether to learn Python or JavaScript first depends on
        what you want to achieve and what interests you most. If you're
        focused on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating websites and web applications</li>
        <li>Developing dynamic user interfaces</li>
        <li>Full-stack development</li>
      </ul>
      <p>JavaScript is definitely the way to go. JavaScript is the
        language of the web, and knowing it will let you get into
        front-end, back-end, and full-stack development.</p>
      <p>However, if your interests lie more in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>General-purpose programming</li>
        <li>Data science</li>
        <li>Automation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Python presents a softer learning curve with a large ecosystem.
        The fact that it also plays a key role in the development and
        growth of AI and machine learning makes it a good skill in
        fast-growing fields.</p>
      <p>For many developers, the journey doesn't end with just one
        language. After mastering Python or JavaScript, you will likely
        expand your knowledge to include the other, making both
        languages incredibly valuable to learn over time. But if you're
        looking for an immediate payoff in web development, JavaScript
        is the way to go.</p>
      <p>Python offers great possibilities due to a number of libraries,
        and it is quite easy for a newcomer to grasp. But at the same
        time, JavaScript is a necessary language to work with web
        applications. Its major role in the sphere of web development
        makes it the more preferable choice if your primary concern is
        web-oriented projects.</p>
