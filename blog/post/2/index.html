      <p>When starting out in the world of programming, choosing the
        right language to learn first can be a pivotal decision. Among
        the most popular and accessible options are Python and
        JavaScript. Both languages are suited to different kinds of
        development. But the question remains: should you learn Python
        or JavaScript first?</p>
      <p>To answer this, we need to consider the usage of the languages,
        and the kinds of projects you want to work on. Let's break this
        down.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2>Let's Learn Python First!</h2>
      <p>Generally speaking in 2024, Python is the language that's
        usually recommended for beginners because of its simplicity and
        readability. Python has relatively clean syntax and, therefore,
        is understandable, which makes it also good to learn. A major
        selling point of Python deals with what you can do with it. You
        can use it for:</p>

            Development (backend)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The good thing about Python is that, in addition to its
        extensive <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://blog.kodezi.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-documentation-in-programming/">documentation</a>,
        the community is typically more friendly to those wanting to
        learn it than the Java community and even the JavaScript
        community. With that in mind, it will be easier to search out
        and find help on <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://daily.dev/blog/11-best-programming-forums-2024">forums</a>
        when you're just starting.</p>
      <p>At the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://blog.blazingcdn.com/en-us/top-code-repositories-for-developers-in-2024">repository</a>
        level, Python is one of the most popular languages on <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners">GitHub</a>.
        That means you're going to find more <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://www.rocket.chat/blog/open-source-projects">open-source
          projects</a> made with Python compared to JavaScript. Once you
        learn Python, you can have access to a large amount of pre-built
        <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/programming-library-guide/">libraries</a>
        and tools, which will make learning and development speedier.
        Additionally, Python has extensive tutorials and <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python">free
          courses available online</a> for learning the subject.</p>
      <p>However, Python isn't used in <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://www.websitebuilderpoint.net/what-is-client-side-in-web-development/">client-side
          development</a>. It would be applicable only on the backend
        side of developing web applications. Its most <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://www.browserstack.com/guide/top-python-web-development-frameworks">recognizable
          frameworks</a> are typically Django and Flask. For instance,
        Python doesn't play a role in composing an interactive, dynamic
        user interface, which modern websites demand. If your primary
        interest lies in web development, especially in <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/front-end-development/">front-end</a>
        development, Python will not be the most appropriate starting
        point.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2>No! Let's Learn JavaScript First!</h2>
      <p><a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://484.cs.uic.edu/readings/chapter-1-http/javascript-intro/#:~:text=JavaScript%20is%20the%20language%20of%20the%20web">JavaScript

          is the language of the web</a>. If you are interested in
        creating interactive websites, dynamic user interfaces, or
        front-end web applications, learning JavaScript is a must.
        JavaScript is the backbone of web interactivity. It powers
        everything including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Animations</li>
        <li><a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://clearout.io/blog/form-validation/#:~:text=Data%20Accuracy%3A%20Form%20validation%20helps,submitting%20harmful%20data%20or%20code">Form
            validation</a></li>
        <li>Client-side data fetching</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In fact, JavaScript is the only language that runs in all
        modern web browsers. Learning JavaScript allows you to write
        code that works directly within the browser. JavaScript is
        perhaps the key language that enables the web to be interactive.</p>
      <p>For a beginner looking to develop web applications, JavaScript
        offers an immediate payoff. With the addition of learning <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/nodejs-tutorial/what-is-nodejs">Node.js</a>
        along with JavaScript, you can use JavaScript for back-end
        development as well. This allows developers to use the same
        language across both the client and server sides, making it a
        powerful tool for full-stack development. Additionally,
        frameworks like <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_intro.asp">Angular</a>,
        and <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_vue.asp">Vue.js</a>
        have further solidified JavaScript as the go-to language for
        building modern web applications.</p>
      <p>Although learning JavaScript might be harder than learning
        Python, it may benefit upcoming developers by opening up more
        job opportunities. Java's syntax is more complex than Python's
        syntax, which makes JavaScript's syntax more complex. That is
        why going from learning JavaScript to Java can be easier than
        going from learning Python to Java.</p>
      <p>It is good to know the demand for JavaScript developers remains
        extremely high, because JavaScript is so widely used across the
        web. A user that masters JavaScript, can use the skills they
        learned to chase after many better job opportunities.<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion: Which Should You Learn First?</h2>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Deciding whether to learn Python or JavaScript first depends on
        what you want to achieve and what interests you most. If you're
        focused on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating websites and web applications</li>
        <li>Developing dynamic user interfaces</li>
        <li>Full-stack development</li>
      </ul>
      <p>JavaScript is definitely the way to go. JavaScript is the
        language of the web, and knowing it will let you get into
        front-end, back-end, and full-stack development.</p>
      <p>However, if your interests lie more in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>General-purpose programming</li>
        <li>Data science</li>
        <li>Automation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Python presents a softer learning curve with a large ecosystem.
        The fact that it also plays a key role in the development and
        growth of AI and machine learning makes it a good skill in
        fast-growing fields.</p>
      <p>For many developers, the journey doesn't end with just one
        language. After mastering Python or JavaScript, you will likely
        expand your knowledge to include the other, making both
        languages incredibly valuable to learn over time. But if you're
        looking for an immediate payoff in web development, JavaScript
        is the way to go.</p>
      <p>Python offers great possibilities due to a number of libraries,
        and it is quite easy for a newcomer to grasp. But at the same
        time, JavaScript is a necessary language to work with web
        applications. Its major role in the sphere of web development
        makes it the more preferable choice if your primary concern is
        web-oriented projects.</p>
