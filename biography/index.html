      <h1>Biography of Sean McLaughlin<br>
      </h1>
      Welcome to my biography page! I am Sean McLaughlin, a passionate
      web developer and lifelong learner.
      <p>When I was younger I spent a lot of my time online. I browsed
        tons of different websites throughout my childhood. I browsed
        through blogs, forums, and of course I frequented some social
        media sites often.<br>
      </p>
      <p>When I was about eight years old I had the idea to write my own
        blog. So with my 2nd grade writing level, I used to write tons
        of fictional stories in Microsoft Word. I eventually ditched
        Microsoft Word and challenged myself to learn HTML, CSS, and JS.
        After learning a little bit of JavaScript, I spent more of my
        time learning programming than writing. As YouTube grew in
        viewers becoming the top website to stream videos online, I
        eventually found myself watching videos instead of continuing to
        program.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks to YouTube, I eventually found myself interested in
        editing video content. I would spend the next six years of my
        life using Vegas Pro. I made AMVs from anime clips I downloaded
        from YouTube. I also made Call of Duty Ghosts montage videos
        that I recorded footage for off the Xbox 360 my parents bought
        for my sister and I. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I entered high school and started making music using Logic Pro
        X on my mac, and even ended up learning Ableton, and FL Studio.
        I was inspired to do this from the videos the YouTube algorithm
        kept recommending I watched. During high school I took
        Multimedia courses where my editing skills only got stronger in
        Premiere Pro. Although I didn't do a lot of work with it, I also
        learned a bit of Adobe After Effects.<br>
      </p>
      <p>While swimming one day I was thinking about what I wanted to do
        with my life. I originally planned on apply to colleges
        undecided. Then I remembered a growing issue almost everywhere
        worldwide. I remembered cyber attacks.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I remembered times my favorite video games and websites were
        inaccessible thanks to some bad actors online. I also remembered
        the hundreds of cyber security videos I watched for a few months
        that the YouTube algorithm kept recommending me for a while. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I knew that my editing skills could land me a few jobs in
        advertising, but I thought that I could make a greater impact on
        the people around me by learning how to help others secure their
        digital assets. It did not take me much longer to get back on
        YouTube and practicing my coding again.<br>
