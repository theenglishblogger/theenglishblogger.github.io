      <p>You might have heard a conspiracy theory from someone in your
        family at the dinner table, that during World War II Nazis had
        time machines. Maybe that conspiracy theory might not have been
        so far fetched.</p>
      <p>I attempted to run the Declaration of Independence famously
        associated with Thomas Jefferson through an AI content detector
        and the work was marked as AI generated. But let’s be real, this
        is more likely a false flag than proof that Thomas Jefferson had
        access to generative AI to help assist him.</p>
      <p>Searching the keywords “declaration of independence ai
        generated” on the popular search engine DuckDuckGo, returns
        several articles and forum posts on the web claiming AI content
        detectors are not always right (including an article from <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jodiecook/2024/07/04/ai-content-detectors-dont-work-the-biggest-mistakes-they-have-made/">Forbes</a>).</p>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p>An article from <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/01/chatgpt-cheating-detection-turnitin/">Washington
          Post</a> details cases in which an AI content detector called
        TurnItIn (designed for schools) was not able to correctly label
        if checked texts were indeed AI generated. TurnItIn, according
        to the article, even displayed warnings that the results the
        program concluded could be wrong.</p>
      <p>So that leaves the question, how hard is it to fool an AI
        content detector. Well according to research from <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://edscoop.com/ai-detectors-are-easily-fooled-researchers-find/">uPenn</a>
        it does not “…take a team of computer scientists to fool many of
        the most popular AI-detection tools” (Wood). The article even
        mentions that the tricks that fool the content detectors are
        “simple”</p>
      <p>One trick is to use an AI content generator that is different
        from what most other students could potentially be using. This
        means that certain prompts you give ChatGPT would be less likely
        to get detected than other prompts similar to the ones the chat
        bot normally sees.</p>
      <p>But if students want to use AI generation to cheat, they are
        probably not going to spend more time fiddling with ChatGPT
        prompts than actually making progress on assignments. If
        fiddling with the prompts took a considerable amount of time,
        the students would likely just write without the help of an AI
        generating content for them.</p>
      <p>With this in mind, students would be more likely to generate
        content from Character AI, Janitor AI, or maybe even the
        Snapchat AI. There is another trick that anybody can do without
        special software.</p>
      <p>Where paragraphs start and end can sometimes fool AI content
        detectors. Therefore a student will be able to get different
        detection results simply by continuously merging and unmerging
        different paragraphs until they get the detection result they
        wanted.</p>
      <p>This method, although not always effective, is much faster than
        writing certain prompts or searching for software the students
        are unfamiliar with. Fortunately for teachers, this method might
        not work for students much longer as detection tools have
        started to group and ungroup paragraphs on their own accord.</p>
